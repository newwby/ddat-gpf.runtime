class_name CompoundActionExtension

# An input management class designed to work alongside InputActionEvents.

# CompoundActionExtension allow for advanced button inputs, such as double
# press inputs within a recent window, holding a button down for a fixed period
# (short or long), or requiring other inputEventActions to fire within a recent
# prior window. They additionally map multiple input events to a single object,
# with keys for alternate actions (based on platform or just player option).
# CompoundActionExtensions attach to InputEvents and are handled
# by the GlobalInputManager singleton, which is where devs should call them.
# Without the GlobalInputManager, CompoundActionExtensions do nothing.

## deprecating combo actions behaviour in first implementation of CIEA

## used for calculating combo actions
## prerequisite input events must have happened recently to 
## preqrequisite input events are signalled via the events
#var _prerequisite_input_event: Array = []
#var _prereq_input_event_tickstamps: Dictionary = {

## if an action is a combo event (it has prerequisite input events) it must have
## the combo of events met recently in order to be valid

## POPULATE PREREQ_INPUT_EVENT_TICKSTAMPS AUTOMATICALLY AT INIT
## ADD FUNC FOR RECIEVING SIGNAL AND STARTING TIMER
